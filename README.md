## About Me

My journey in technology began in data management, where process optimization and information integrity sparked my interest.

 This focus has led me to explore the fundamentals of infrastructure and security, which I consider to be the pillars of any technological system.

 As a self-taught learner, my studies are oriented toward data protection, privacy, and technological autonomy. My commitment is to continue building my knowledge in a practical way, applying what I learn in projects that allow me to keep growing in these areas.
