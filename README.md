## About Me

My curiosity for technology led me to explore the digital world. What began as a simple interest in IT fundamentals, which sparked my curiosity for data, is where my interest evolved into a deep passion for privacy, security, and technological autonomy, pillars that I consider essential for safeguarding information in the digital age.

As a self-taught, I practically apply what I learn, focusing on data protection and secure infrastructure. My commitment is to continue growing in these fields, always seeking the most efficient and scalable way to solve technological challenges.
